Project Name: Ohio Covid-19 Dashboard 
This is supposed to be a single-page application that uses React and connects to an API
to download and display data on Covid-19 and Ohio. However, I couldn't get the API to
work so I hardcoded 14 days worth of data to get the resulting dashboard. 

Installation and Setup Instructions:
Clone this repository. You will need npm and React installed globally on your machine. 

Installation: npm install
To Run Test Suite: npm test
To start Server: npm start
To Visit App: localhost:3000/dashboard
